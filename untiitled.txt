Java 8 features
-----------------------
1.Interface enhancement
2.functional interface
3.lambda expression(anonymous function)-->does something and return something
4.Stream api which help us easily handle collections
5.date time api(operate with data dn time classes without using date formater or more..)

--------------------------------------------
1.interface enhancement
default method
In java7 if we want to add anew functionality then the classes who are implemneting the vehicle will show us erro that u have its implemnettaion.
to address this java said i will give u a default method

@we can have one or more default method in interface 
it help us achieve backword compatibility

@STATIC METHOD==>
you cannot override static methods
static method are same as default but dont get available in implementing class



FUNCTIONAL INTERFACE(SAM)(single abstarct method)
dont have to create a class .
create an object
call a method and get and set things

you dont have to create a java class 
u dont have to create a method
bypass concept of clas and methods

1.Must have only 1 abstarct method
2.Can have static methods 
3.Can have default methods
4.It act as placeholdeer for a lambda function


STREAM API
All collections can call streams and use themr4

paralle stream
if u r not worried about the sequence

where u need to maintain order do not go for parallel stream

------------------------------------------------------
PREDICATES
->Predefined functional interface
->return boolean



MAP
helps to transform the data
